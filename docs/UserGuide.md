   * **`add`**` Do laundry p/low b/31/12/2017 12:00` : Jim wants to do laundry at noon, so he adds it to the task manager.
   * **`sort`**` priority` : Jim wants to see the most urgent tasks at the top of his list.
   * **`mark`**` 1 2` : Jim realises he has completed the 1st and 2nd task so he marks them as completed.
   * **`delete`**` 3` : Jim realises he does not have to complete the 3rd task so he deletes it from his current list.
   * **`find`**` laundry` : Jim gets a call from his mum that the laundry must be completed by 3pm so he does a search for it.
   * **`edit`**` 1 p/hi` : Jim updates the priority of the found laundry task to high.
   * **`list`** : Jim wants to get back to the overview of his list of tasks.
   * **`exit`** : Jim is done for the day so he decides to exit the application!
